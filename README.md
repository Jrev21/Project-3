# $ Project Name
$Project_Name is an application which takes United States Census data and compares population changes over time.

## Overview
$Project_Name was created with Revature as a demonstration of Big Data techniques and simulation of working with Big Data.
Using a sample dataset of approximately 60 million rows, taken from publicly available US Census data, the application queries 
the data to determine information on a variety of subjects regarding total population and racial distribution. Information from these queries is then visualized using Tableau.

$ Notable items/things to pay attention to

The data for each census year has been cleaned, queried to relevant information, and outputted as .csv files. These files are included as part of this repository as [output00.csv](https://github.com/Revature-Big-Data-Capstone-1348/Project-3/blob/main/output00.csv), 
[output10.csv](https://github.com/Revature-Big-Data-Capstone-1348/Project-3/blob/main/output10.csv), and [output20.csv](https://github.com/Revature-Big-Data-Capstone-1348/Project-3/blob/main/output20.csv). Steps taken to replicate our cleaning process may be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Revature-Big-Data-Capstone-1348/Project-3/wiki).
